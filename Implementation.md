== Implementation

The implementation is structured into phases to ensure efficient and modular development.

=== Step 1: Setting Up the Backend Infrastructure

Initialize the Spring Boot Reactive Project:

Create a multi-module Maven project.

Add dependencies for:

Spring WebFlux (for reactive endpoints).

Spring Data R2DBC (PostgreSQL).

Spring Data MongoDB Reactive.

Elasticsearch Java Client.

RabbitMQ Java Client (for message broker integration).

Configure Database Connections:

MongoDB: Configure a reactive connection for storing raw articles and enriched data.

PostgreSQL: Use R2DBC for structured trend data and ingestion logs.

Elasticsearch: Set up a connection for indexing and querying article metadata.

Set Up RabbitMQ:

Install RabbitMQ on the local environment or use a cloud service.

Define exchanges and queues:

Exchange: news.exchange

Queues:

raw-news-queue

sentiment-queue

trend-queue

geo-queue

=== Step 2: Implement Microservices

News Ingestion Service:

Fetch Data:

Use Spring WebClient to consume NewsAPI with configurable parameters (e.g., keywords, dates).

Store Data:

Save raw news data in MongoDB.

Publish Events:

Convert raw articles to event payloads and publish to RabbitMQ on raw-news-queue.

Index Data:

Index metadata (e.g., titles, authors, timestamps) into Elasticsearch.

Sentiment Analysis Service:

Subscribe to Events:

Consume messages from raw-news-queue.

Perform Sentiment Analysis:

Use a pre-trained model (e.g., BERT or Vader).

Publish Enriched Events:

Publish enriched articles to sentiment-queue.

Trend Analysis Service:

Subscribe to Events:

Consume messages from sentiment-queue.

Analyze Trends:

Perform time-series analysis using libraries like JFreeChart or custom ARIMA implementations.

Store Trends:

Save trend insights into PostgreSQL.

Geographic Processing Service:

Subscribe to Events:

Consume messages from raw-news-queue.

Process Locations:

Extract geographic metadata using NLP or APIs.

Publish Geo-Enriched Events:

Publish location-enriched data to geo-queue.

API Gateway:

Define Endpoints:

/search: Query Elasticsearch for articles by keywords.

/trends: Retrieve trend data from PostgreSQL.

/geo: Fetch geographic insights from processed events.

Reactive Handling:

Use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing and non-blocking responses.

=== Step 3: Testing and Validation

Service-Level Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for each service:

Mock NewsAPI responses for ingestion.

Test sentiment analysis with sample data.

Use JUnit 5 and Reactor Test for reactive streams.

Integration Testing:

Simulate event flows between services.

Validate RabbitMQ queues, database interactions, and Elasticsearch queries.

System Testing:

Simulate high-load conditions to test backpressure handling.

Evaluate the latency of end-to-end workflows.

=== Step 4: Deployment

Containerization:

Dockerize each microservice, including dependencies like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch.

Use Docker Compose to orchestrate services locally.

Orchestration:

Deploy services on Kubernetes for scalability.

Use Helm charts to manage configurations.

CI/CD Pipeline:

Automate build and deployment using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

Include steps for running tests, building Docker images, and deploying to staging and production environments.

=== Step 5: Monitoring and Maintenance

Distributed Tracing:

Integrate Zipkin or Jaeger for tracing inter-service calls.

Visualize message flows between RabbitMQ, databases, and APIs.

Performance Monitoring:

Set up Prometheus and Grafana for metrics monitoring.

Monitor message queue lag, API response times, and database performance.

Periodic Updates:

Regularly update dependencies and frameworks.

Refactor code for performance optimization as needed.

== Milestones

Milestone 1: Backend Infrastructure Setup

Complete database configurations for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch.

Set up RabbitMQ with defined queues and exchanges.

Milestone 2: Microservice Development

Implement and test the News Ingestion, Sentiment Analysis, Trend Analysis, and Geographic Processing services.

Milestone 3: Frontend Development

Develop a user-friendly dashboard integrating with the API Gateway.

Milestone 4: Testing and Optimization

Perform system-wide testing for functionality, performance, and resilience.

Milestone 5: Deployment

Deploy the system to a staging environment and finalize production deployment.

== Gathering Results

Validation of Requirements:

Verify that all features (e.g., keyword search, sentiment analysis, time-series trends, and heatmaps) function as intended.

Performance Evaluation:

Measure system responsiveness under typical and high-load scenarios.

Monitor backpressure handling and service latencies.

User Feedback:

Collect feedback from early users (general consumers, researchers, and analysts).

Iterate on the application to improve usability and feature relevance.
