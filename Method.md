=== High-Level Architecture

The application will follow a modular architecture, comprising the following key components:

Data Ingestion Layer:

Fetch news articles from NewsAPI using keyword-based and topic-based queries.

Store raw data in a centralized data repository for processing.

Data Processing Layer:

Sentiment Analysis: Use pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze the sentiment of articles.

Time-Series Analysis: Analyze data trends over time using time-series algorithms like ARIMA or seasonal decomposition.

Geographic Mapping: Extract location metadata from articles and visualize trends using geospatial libraries (e.g., GeoPandas, Mapbox).

Data Storage:

Use a combination of databases:

Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data like keywords, locations, and timestamps.

NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing article metadata and raw JSON responses.

Frontend Dashboard:

Interactive user interface using React or Angular.

Visualize data via charts, time-series graphs, and heatmaps using D3.js or Plotly.

Backend API:

Built with Java 21 and Spring Boot Reactive for asynchronous, non-blocking operations.

Provide RESTful and reactive endpoints to support frontend operations.

Handle user queries for keyword search, trend analysis, and geographic data.

=== Algorithms and Techniques

Sentiment Analysis:

Use a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT) fine-tuned for sentiment classification.

Time-Series Analysis:

Implement ARIMA for trend detection or seasonal decomposition to highlight patterns.

Geographic Heatmaps:

Use GeoPandas to process location data and Mapbox for visualization.

Keyword Search:

Implement a search engine using Elasticsearch for fast and scalable search capabilities.

=== Technology Stack

Frontend: React/Angular, D3.js/Plotly

Backend: Java 21, Spring Boot Reactive

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch
